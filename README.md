# PowerBi-Sales-project
The objective of this Power BI project is to analyze sales performance, product demand, and customer distribution across different years. The dashboard provides a visual representation of key metrics to assist in data-driven decision-making.

## project description
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer distribution. The dataset includes various business dimensions such as:

- Sales by Product Line – Identifies top-performing product categories.
- Sales by Product Name – Highlights revenue contribution from individual products.
- Quantity Ordered Over the Years – Displays sales volume trends from 2003 to 2005.
- Profit Analysis – Summarizes the total profit earned.
- Geographical Distribution of Customers – A map visualization showing customer concentration in different regions.

# Process of Building the project

# 1)Data Collection & Preparation
- Imported datasets including customers, employees, offices, order details, orders, payments, product lines, and products.
- Cleaned and transformed data in Power Query by handling missing values, renaming columns, and creating relationships.
- Performed data modeling by establishing relationships between tables (fact and dimension tables).

# 2) Creating Measures & Calculations
-Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures, such as:
- Total Sales = SUM of sales amounts.
- Total Profit = Revenue - Cost.
- Quantity Ordered by Year using SUM aggregation.

# 3)  Designing the Dashboard
- Added interactive slicers for filtering by year (2003, 2004, 2005).
- Created key visualizations:
- Pie Chart for sales distribution by product line.
- Bar Chart for top-selling products.
- Column Chart for quantity ordered over different years.
- KPI Cards to highlight Total Profit and Sales Growth.
- Map Visualization for geographical customer distribution.

 # 4. Enhancing User Interactivity
- Enabled cross-filtering between visuals.
- Applied drill-through functionality for detailed analysis.
- Used conditional formatting to highlight performance metrics.

# 5. Testing & Optimization
- Ensured all visualizations were accurate and provided meaningful insights.
- Optimized dashboard performance by reducing unnecessary calculations.
- Verified responsiveness and user experience.
